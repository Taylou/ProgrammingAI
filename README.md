Detection and Prediction of anomalies in time series sensor data, along with maintenance for Factories
The project is about detecting and predicting anomalies in a time series dataset of pump sensor data. the dataset contains sensor readings from 53 sensors.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of time series data from 53 sensors in a pump. It contains several features such as temperature, The dataset has three main points which are normal, broken and recovering

Project Objective

The objective of this project is to detect and predict anomalies in the pump sensor data. To achieve this objective, I used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm for anomaly detection and prediction.

Project Tasks

I divided it into several tasks:

1. Data exploration and preprocessing: I explored the dataset and preprocessed it for further analysis. This will involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and scaling the data.

2. Feature analysis and selection: I performed feature analysis to identify the most important features. then used feature selection techniques to select the most relevant features.

3. Model development and evaluation: I developed  LSTM model for anomaly detection and prediction. Then trained and evaluate the model on the preprocessed dataset and compare their performance.

Project Results

The project results includes:

1. Preprocessed dataset: A cleaned and scaled dataset ready for analysis.

2. Selected features: features for anomaly detection and prediction.

3. Trained models: LSTM model trained on the preprocessed dataset.
